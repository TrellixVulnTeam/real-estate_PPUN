			<p>Residential real estate refers to properties used for residential purposes. When it
				comes to
				residential real
				estate, there are two things to keep in mind: The location of the property and its expenses. This
				article will go
				into detail about various things to look for in a profitable residential property.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The location in which the property resides will determine the type of tenants and the vacant rate. If
				you buy
				properties near a university, students may struggle to pay rent, and there would be vacancies during the
				summer.
				However, properties near a post-secondary institution and growing employment opportunities attract
				tenants.
				Crimes deter tenets. As such, it's good to research crime statistics, the rate of vandalism, and the
				frequency
				of police presence. Beyond that, look for properties with a lot of construction as it shows potential
				for future
				development.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>How much money could you potentially make or lose from your investment? First, let's take in account of
				insurance. Were natural disasters to arise, the insurance coverage will eat away at your rental income.
				As such,
				look for places with a low risk of fires, earthquakes or floods. Next, check whether property tax
				increases are
				probable in the future. This is a great indicator that financial distress is at play, and you will
				potentially
				lose money to vacancies.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>In conclusion, look for properties that will support amenities, employment opportunities, and
				education. Ensure
				that any property income can cover the mortgage payment, taxes, and other expenses in the near future.
				Most
				importantly, know that even if you make money now; you can lose money at any time. Like any investment,
				there's
				no grantee. </p>

				Interview</h2>
			<hr>
			<img src="img/interview.png">
			<h3>What were your financial expectations?</h3>
			<p>I donâ€™t have any. I would just rather do that than pension. I have some money in the bank from selling my
				own property. I didn't want the money to have the money sitting in the bank so I decided to buy another
				house, which I wasn't going to live in. I didn't really have any financial expectations. I just kind of
				didn't want to spend the money. If I have the money in the bank, I might just spend it on stuff like
				holidays and cars and things like
				that so I thought I'd invest in property. So yeah, I thought I'd invest it, rather than, than just
				having a sign in the bank. So I didn't really have any financial expectations. It was just a case of if
				I have all this money in the bank, it might disappear. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>What are your liabilities?</h3>
			<p>Liabilities, I obviously have my mortgages. So I have mortgages to pay for my property outright, the bank
				perhaps and really just a certain percentage of them. So yeah, my main liabilities would be my
				mortgages, which I have to pay every month. And that's about it really. I have a lot of bills to pay
				because we pay all the tax bills. But yeah, my main liabilities would be mortgages and the insurances.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>What's the hardest part about your job?</h3>
			<p>What's the hardest? I mean I don't know. For me, the hardest part is probably managing all the properties
				and making sure there's enough money coming into to cover everything. And keep on top of maintenance as
				well. And probably the hardest thing was that giving up control and giving it to somebody else to manage
				the day to day. This is because I don't manage the day to day stuff, somebody else does that for me. So
				I've given them control over my properties. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Why do you think you became successful in real estate?</h3>
			<p>I didn't if I'm successful, but like, I'm quite a driven person. So if I want something it normally
				happens. So yeah, I'm quite driven. I suppose I had a lot of how I had a lot of help from people who
				knew what they were doing. And yeah I'm just quite a driven person if I want something I go out and get
				it. I was willing to put the work in. Not many people were willing to sacrifice time at the moment to
				live a better life later on. I've always been like, succeeding in what I wanted to do.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Do you have any tips/advice?</h3>
			<p>Just probably like, just shadow somebody. Go find some people who already do what you are doing and
				just shadow people. Read lots of books. But yeah that's it just like there's loads of like stuff on
				YouTube and like anything you want to do go on YouTube. There's research, read a few
				books, but yeah just find some people who already do it and shadow them is what I would say. Yeah,
				that's a really good advice to give. But yeah, just find some people around. everybody's will want to
				share their story. Exactly yes, people do like to talk about themselves.

			<hr>

					<h3>Reflect on the interview process...</h3>
					<p>The interview process was long. I spent the majority of time asking questions within questions.
						It was more of a casual conversation than an interview. While I did not learn anything new, it
						was fun.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Reflect on the process of converting the interview into written form...</h3>
					<p>It was torture. I had "10" interview questions, but I decided to use only 5 for the written
						version. The reason is that those 5 are the only ones that aren't off-topic. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="columns">
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Reflect on the process of converting the written form into the website...</h3>
					<p>This part was fun. At first, I didn't have a clear picture of what the website should look like.
						As a result, I have some conflicts with my code. I really wanted to implement a dark and light
						mode option, but that would require me to overwrite my existing code.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Reflect in general on the project...</h3>
					<p>I wished I could have gone with a different topic. Real estate is a boring topic to talk about. I
						could interview my cousin on domestic abuse. LGBTQ+ would work well with my colour scheme.
						Philosophy and psychology are topics I'm passionate about. Anything would be better than the
						topic that I chose.</p>
